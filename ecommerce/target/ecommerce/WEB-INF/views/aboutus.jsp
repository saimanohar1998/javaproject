	 They worked for Amazon.com, and left to create their new company incorporated in October 2007 as Flipkart Online Services Pvt. 
	 Ltd. The first product they sold was the book Leaving Microsoft To Change The World to a customer from Hyderabad.
	 shopping.com now employs more than 33,000 people.Flipkart allows payment methods such as cash on delivery, credit or debit 
	 card transactions, net banking, e-gift voucher and card swipe on delivery.
	After failure of its 2014 Big Billion Sale, Flipkart recently completed the second edition of Big Billion Sale held 
	between 13 and 17 October. where it is reported that they saw a business turnover of $300 million in gross merchandise volume.</h4> <br>
	<h2>Business Structure</h2> <br>
	<h4>In a report dated 25 November 2014, a leading media outlet reported that Flipkart were operating through a complex business 
	structure which included nine firms, some registered in Singapore and some in India. In 2012 Flipkart co-founders sold WS Retail 
	to a consortium of investors led by Rajeev Kuchhal.</h4> <br>
	<h2>Finance</h2> <br>
	<h4>Initially, they had spent â‚¹400,000 (US$5,900) only for making the website to set up the business. Flipkart has
	 later raised funding from venture capital funds Accel India ($1 million in 2009) and Tiger Global ($10 million in
	  2010 and $20 million in June 2011).On 24 August 2012, Flipkart announced the completion of its 4th round of $150 
	  million funding from MIH (part of Naspers Group) and ICONIQ Capital. The company announced, on 10 July 2013, that it has raised
	   an additional $200 million from existing investors including Tiger Global, Naspers, Accel Partners and Iconiq Capital.<br>

	and â‚¹750 million (US$11 million) for FY 2010â€“2011. In FY 2011â€“2012, Flipkart is set to cross the â‚¹5 billion (US$74 million) mark

	  reach â‚¹10 billion (US$150 million) by year 2014. On average, Flipkart sells nearly 10 products per minute and is aiming at generating
	   a revenue of â‚¹50 billion (US$740 million) by 2015.<br>
	On November 2012, Flipkart became one of the companies being probed for alleged violations of FDI regulations of the Foreign Exchange
	 Management Act, 1999
Flipkart reported a loss of â‚¹2.81 billion (US$42 million) for the FY 2012-13. In July 2013, Flipkart raised $160 million from 
private equity investors.
In October 2013, it was reported that Flipkart had raised an additional $160 million from new investors Dragoneer Investment 
Group, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, Sofina SA and Vulcan Inc. with participation from existing investor Tiger Global.
On 26 May 2014, Flipkart announced that it has raised $210 million from Yuri Milnerâ€™s DST Global and its existing investors

likely listing in the US for 2016.
On 29 July 2014, Flipkart announced that it raised $1 billion from Tiger Global Management LLC, Accel Partners, and Morgan Stanley 
Investment Management and a new investor Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC.<br>
On 6 October 2014, Flipkart sold products worth â‚¹6.5 billion (US$97 million) in 10 hours in a special one-day event - "The Big Billion Day",
claiming they had created e-commerce history, but their hard-won reputation for good customer service suffered because of technical problems,
 and angry reactions on social media from buyers disappointed with the pricing and availability of products. It claimed to sell a 
 whopping 500,000 mobile handsets, 500,000 clothes and shoes and 25,000 television sets within hours of opening its discounted sale at 8 AM.
  In December 2014, After it received $700 million from another funding, Flipkart had a market cap of $11 billion. In May 2015 Flipkart has 
  raised $550 million from some of its existing investors, in a deal that raises the valuation of the privately held Indian startup to about $15 
  billion.<br>

after raising $700 million for long term strategic investments in India following which its number of investors exceeded 50. The $700 
million fund raised by Flipkart added new investorsâ€”Baillie Gifford, Greenoaks Capital, Steadview Capital, T. Rowe Price Associates and 
Qatar Investment Authorityâ€”on company's board.Its existing investors DST Global, GIC, ICONIQ Capital and Tiger Global also participated in
 this latest financing round.

</h4><br>
<h2>Criticism</h2><br>
<h4>On 13 September 2014, a Flipkart delivery boy molested a house maid in Hyderabad. The house maid's employer has been fighting 
against Flipkart for justice on this issue, and also for making offline delivery services safe.<br>
On 6 October 2014 Flipkart launched a promotion called 'Big Billion Day' with the intention to increase the popularity of their 
website by targeting a billion sales in 1 day. This, even though Flipkart achieved the target, led to public outcry and widespread 
criticism among consumers, competitors and partners, heavily damaging its reputation. Many users could not place orders because of 
high server load and errors which led to frustration among customers. Many users who placed orders received emails stating that their orders
 were cancelled. Most of the products were sold for less than cost price, and Flipkart was accused of killing competition. Major competitors 
 filed complaints against Flipkart to the commerce ministry, claiming that selling products lesser than cost prices is against the commerce
  policy of the country. The Ministry said that they would formulate new trade rules for electronic retail after this incident.<br>
Flipkart received mass criticism on the subject of net neutrality after their announced partnership with Airtel to use the Airtel Zero 
platform which would have made the Flipkart app free for Airtel Users. On 14 April 2015 Flipkart retracted its decision to use Airtel Zero 
platform.<br>
